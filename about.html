					<h1>About Me</h1>
					
					<p>
					I am a theoretical/computational physicist with a PhD from Monash University. My PhD research examined the accuracy in the reconstruction of three dimensional electromagnetic vector fields using transmission electron microscopy. For this work, I developed skills in the production of highly realistic electron-optical simulations, algorithm design and implementation, and data analysis.
					
					I have a passion for anything&mdash;creative or technical&mdash;that utilises computers and other technology. This includes programming, physics simulations, 3D modelling, game development, music production, and digital drawing. In the small amount of spare time I have left, I like to juggle, knit and crochet, play board and video games, and spend time with my girlfriend and our cats.
					<br><br>
					If you're currently hiring, and think that I may have the skills you're after, feel free to check out my <a href="./cv/LaTeX/Zac Kemp - Resume.pdf">CV</a> and <a href="contact.html">get in touch.</a>
