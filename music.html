		<h1>Music</h1>
		<p>
		Just some of my music&mdash;all produced using softsynths (<i>Spire</i> is my current go-to) and a DAW (usually Bitwig at the moment). Stylistically, most of my music falls under the broad umbrella of "trance", but I've been branching out a bit lately with some house, drum and bass, and other genres (not all posted yet). Except where otherwise stated, vocals are from royalty-free sample packs. Hover over genre to see the description, and hover over a track to see my own thoughts about it.

			<br>
			<br>

			<b>Nb: Please be patient while the tracks load. I'm currently experimenting with different ways of loading. At the moment, all tracks will load in the background when you are on the music page, meaning you can switch between genres without having to wait for it to load again, but with the drawback that the initial loading is long.</b>

				<span class="tooltiptext"><div id="before"> </div><div id="after"></div>
					These are currently mostly "anthem" style hard trance tracks. It's a style that has a lot of emotive qualities due to its chord structure and uplifting melodies, so for my personal taste, there is more to get from this style&mdash;as a listener&mdash;than the more meditative styles of trance that have less complex chord structures and more repetitive melodic motifs. I have worked on other sub-genres of trance, and probably will again, so it's likely I will include some more here in the future.</span>

				<li class="tooltip" onmouseover="positionMarker(this); enableOverlay(this);" onclick="setActive(this); setGenre('house');"><a>House</a>
				<span class="tooltiptext"><div id="before"> </div><div id="after"></div>
					
			I'm not an avid listener of house music, but it's a style I do enjoy working on. I like the spacious, live-music feel that can be achieved with this style, and the slower tempo makes a great change of pace from the trance tracks I usually produce, so I mostly work on on a soft, funky style of vocal house&mdash; deep house, maybe? I prefer to use as few samples as possible in my music, but due to the requirement of good quality vocals in this style, my mediocre singing abilities, and the fact that I usually prefer female vocals in house, I use vocal samples a lot here.</span>
				</li>
				
				<li class="tooltip" onmouseover="positionMarker(this); enableOverlay(this);" onclick="setActive(this); setGenre('drumAndBass');"><a>Drum and Bass</a>
				<span class="tooltiptext"><div id="before"> </div><div id="after"></div>
					
			Although it's not a style I listen to much, I find a lot of drum and bass quite interesting, so I thought I'd give it a go. I have attempted to work on the style in the past without much success, but trying again recently, I found that the production skills I've gained working on other styles transferred well, and I'm very happy with the results. These tracks tend to be mostly beat-driven, with complex percussion centre stage, rather than having a strong focus on rich and interesting basslines that a lot of drum and bass has, although I would like to try focussing more on that side of the style in the future. </span>

					This section is for anything that doesn't fit into any of the other sections. It includes tracks that could fit into a specific genre if I had enough tracks of that style to give them their own section, as well as tracks that don't actually <i>have</i> a clearly defined genre.

				<span class="tooltiptext"><div id="before"> </div><div id="after"> </div>
			These are tracks that have a complete enough sample to be considered remixes, as well as anything that would be considered a 'cover'. I try to avoid copyright infringement, so most of my remixes utilise vocals under a creative commons licence, and links are provided to the original source for each track. When I use an a cappella, I usually avoid listening to the original artist's mix first so as not to be influenced by it, and I typically only use the vocals, so for most of these the term "remix" is applied fairly loosely.</span>
