		<h1>Media</h1>
		<p>
		This page showcases some of my videos and images. Most of it is creative work, but some is related to my simulations and other physics related work.

		<h2>Conflict</h2>

		<p>This is a game I started working on during the small amount of spare time I had during the last year of my PhD. As it got closer to the thesis submission date, and I was spending almost every waking hour refining my writing and performing any additional simulations that needed to be done, I had to abandon it. I would still love to complete this one day if I have the time.
		<br><br>
		The genre is intended to be danmaku (bullet hell), although given that there is only one level complete at the moment, that might not be obvious. I also ran into performance problems with the large number of projectiles, which are apparent as stuttering in the demo video, and I need to solve those issues before working on the more intense later levels. Given that a typical danmaku game has five or six basic levels (which are usually repeated at a higher difficulty after completing the first playthrough), it would not be a monumental task to finish this game. I also have all the music written for each level.
		<br><br>
		Here is some gameplay of the completed first level (the first 3:18), as well as some bits and pieces:

		<h2>ShaderToy Simulations</h2>

		<p>
		Here are a couple of physical simulations I programmed in GLSL. The first one is a simulation of an orbital system that I was using to try to work out how to achieve occlusion, perspective, and diffuse lighting. The second is a simulation of Young's double-slit experiment.

		<h2>Octahedral Particle</h2>
		<nav>
			<ul>

		<p>
		This is a render of the simulated particle that was was used for the work published in my <a href="documents/PhysRevA.90.023859.pdf">first paper</a>. The particle was created by lining up edges and faces of a 3D model with those of two tomograms (red and blue point-clouds). For more details, please read the paper.</p>

		<h2>Digital Drawings</h2>

		These are some drawings I have created using Adobe Photoshop or other image editing software such as Manga Studio.

		<h3>Hans</h3>
		<p>
		This was an exercise in drawing a cartoony face, and editing and tidying it up to achieve some level of sophistication. I was very pleased with the result here. The first image is the finished work, and the second is some steps in the progression from start to finish.

		<h3>Portraits</h3>
		<p>
		These are just random portraits that I drew. The first one is roughly based on a photograph. There is some skin from the photograph blended in to add some wrinkles. The second one is also based on a photograph. I was aiming for realism here, and although there are plenty of areas for improvement, I'm certainly happy with the result.
