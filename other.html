		<h2>Conflict</h2>
		<p>This is a game I started working on during the small amount of spare time I had during the last year of my PhD. As it got closer to the thesis submission date, and I was spending almost every waking hour refining my writing and performing any additional simulations that needed to be done, I had to abandon it. I would still love to complete this one day if I have the time.
		
		The genre is intended to be danmaku (bullet hell), although given that there is only one level complete at the moment, that might not be obvious. I also ran into performance problems with the large number of projectiles, which are apparent as stuttering in the demo video, and I need to solve those issues before working on the more intense later levels. Given that a typical danmaku game has five or six basic levels (which are usually repeated at a higher difficulty after completing the first playthrough), it would not be a monumental task to finish this game. I also have all the music written for each level.
		
		Here is some gameplay of the completed first level (the first 3:18), as well as some bits and pieces:

		Here are a couple of physical simulations programmed in GLSL.
