			<h1>About This Website / Technical Support</h1>
			<p>
					Although I make every effort to make this website as accessible as possible, I'm just one guy working on it. I'm writing it from scratch (with a little help from Stack Overflow) using html, javascript, and css, and given that I don't have any web development credentials or experience, there are probably a lot of special cases I haven't considered. I'm developing it on the <b>latest version of Google Chrome on a desktop PC, so this is guaranteed to be the best way to view it.</b> I test it from time to time on other browsers, but <b>it's almost certain not to work well on mobile yet.</b>

					<b>If you are having any issues with a particular browser, or any other problems with the site, please send me a bug report or feature request via my contact page or email (below)</b>; I'll be sure to prioritise your request.
