					  "<i>Archetype</i> is probably my favourite drum and bass track. It's got ethereal vocals and tight, yet complex, percussion. Although there's not much melodic variety, the percussion is intricate enough, in my opinion, to maintain the listener's interest.",

					  "the-pharmers",
					  "<i>The Pharmers</i> is a more commercial-sounding track, with a high level of polish. While the style of the percussion puts it firmly in the drum and bass genre, it has some specific elements, as well as a general 'smoothness', that make it somewhat reminiscent of some of my vocal house tracks.",
					  "c");
		generateTrack(2930053, 
					  "False Flag", 
					  "false-flag",
					  "One thing I particularly like about <i>False Flag</i> is that it manages to create a sense of having a slower underlying beat, with a more fast-paced drum and bass beat filling in the gaps. It's quite dark and, like <i>Archetype</i> is mostly percussion-driven.",
					  "r");

					  "<i>150mg</i> is a nice abmient drum and bass track with a bit of an 'IDM' feel. I quite like the feel of it, and I'd like to explore this style further in the future.",
