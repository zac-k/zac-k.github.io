						  "l");
						  
			generateTrack(3051323, 
						  "Elegant Burn", 
						  "elegant-burn",
						  "<i>Elegant Burn</i> is another solid trance anthem. Less of an uplifting vibe than <i>Repository</i>, and more of a rough energy to it.",
						  "c");
			generateTrack(3058635, 
						  "Discovery 7", 
						  "discovery-7-LuC",
						  "<i>Discovery 7</i> is less 'radio-friendly' than the previous two tracks, but it's one of my favourite tracks. Although it's still firmly in the hard trance genre, the beat leans towards a disco sound. For me, it evokes 80's futurism imagery. I feel I managed to achieve the intensity of hard trance without compromising on the retro-futurism feel I was going for.",
						  "r");
			generateTrack(2930051, 
						  "Sublimation", 
						  "sublimation",
						  "<i>Sublimation</i> is good, generic hard trance. It has a long build up, leading to a satisfying drop and a confident anthem. Note that I don't use the term \"generic\" as a negative. It's just my way of acknowledging that it doesn't break a lot of 'rules' of the genre.",
						  "l");
			generateTrack(2930047, 
						  "Tertium Septendecim", 
						  "tertium-septendecim",
						  "<i>Tertium Septendecim</i> is another hard trance anthem with a long build up. The melody is less emotionally complex than than those in most of my other anthems, but has a great upbeat vibe and plenty of energy.",
						  "c");
			generateTrack(2930055, 
						  "Recrudescence", 
						  "recrudescence",
						  "<i>Recrudescence</i> is yet another good, generic anthem, but with a shorter build-up to the drop than the previous two tracks. There's not much more to say about this one. If you liked the previous two tracks, you'll probably like this one too.",
						  "r");
			generateTrack(2676061, 
						  "Voyager 7", 
						  "voyager-7",
						  "I personally love <i>Voyager 7</i>. The pace is slower than most of my other trance tracks, which allows for a different mood, and I've managed to nail the laid-back, yet uplifting, vibe. This is a really cohesive track that manages to achieve a professional sound without any compromises on creativity.",
						  "l");
			generateTrack(2930063, 
						  "Omicron", 
						  "omicron",
						  "<i>Omicron</i> is an intense and high energy track: it puts the \"hard\" in \"hard trance\". If I have any reservations about this one, it's that there isn't much melodic variety; most of the development is in building of intensity of the musical elements. I really like it because of its strengths, but it's one of the few that I've posted here that I would do a bit differently if I was working on it today.",
						  "c");
			generateTrack(2676209, 
						  "ht5", 
						  "ht5-remastered",
						  "<i>ht5</i> is one of my older trance tracks (from around the late 00's). It's got more of an old-school vibe to it. I love the melody, and have always been happy with the track over all, but my technical skills have progressed signifigantly since I made this, and there are things I would do differently if I was producing it today.",
						  "r");
			generateTrack(3080785, 
						  "Biochemical", 
						  "biochemical-bh3",
						  "<i>Biochemical</i> is another fairly old one. It's probably the first one I was happy with when going for a bit of a psy-trance feel. Although it might not actually quite qualify as psy-trance due to its slower tempo, among other things, it's got a lot of the elements in it, and it's got a cool feel to it, regardless of genre.",
						  "l");
			generateTrack(3109100, 
						  "Space 7", 
						  "space-7",
						  "<i>Space 7</i> is another old-school psy-trance influenced one, again with a slower tempo than is typical for the style. I really love the feel of this one, and I wouldn't mind exploring this style more in the future.",
						  "c");
			generateTrack(3090047, 
						  "Whiskers", 
						  "whiskersmastered1",
						  "<i>Whiskers</i> is what I would call \"easy listening hard trance\". It has similar instrumentation and structure to the anthem style tracks, and the melody has an uplifting mood, but never breaks out into a full-on anthem. A part of me can't help wondering where this could have gone if I put an anthemic melody on top of the main one (like I did for the initial drop at the 3:40 mark in <i>Elegant Burn</i>, for example), but I think there's a place for easier listening tracks like this, and I'm glad I resisted the urge to make turn it into something else.",
