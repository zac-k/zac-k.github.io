			<div class="abstract">Determining the phase of a wave from intensity measurements has many applications in fields such as electron microscopy, visible light optics, and medical imaging. Propagation based phase retrieval, where the phase is obtained from defocused images, has shown significant promise. There are, however, limitations in the accuracy of the retrieved phase arising from such methods. Sources of error include shot noise, image misalignment, and diffraction artifacts. We explore the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to improve the accuracy of propagation based phase retrieval algorithms. We employ a phase retrieval algorithm based on the transport-of-intensity equation to obtain the phase from simulated micrographs of procedurally generated specimens. We then train an ANN with pairs of retrieved and exact phases, and use the trained ANN to process a test set of retrieved maps. The total error in the phase is significantly reduced using this method. We also discuss a variety of potential extensions to this work.</div><br>

			<div class="abstract">Vector field electron tomography is a relatively new technique for quantitative three-dimensional imaging, combining phase retrieval with vector tomography to reconstruct electromagnetic fields, potentials, and sources, from transmission electron micrographs. Vector field electron tomography reconstructs electromagnetic vector fields (i.e., the vector potential, magnetic induction field, and current density) associated with magnetic nanomaterials, such as magnetic recording media, spintronics devices, grain boundaries in hard magnets, and magnetic particles for biomedical applications. Although there is a range of techniques for characterising magnetic nanomaterials, such as Kerr microscopy, magnetic force microscopy, and Lorentz microscopy, these techniques only provide projections or surface components of the vector field. Vector field electron tomography takes projections of the potential obtained using electron holography, acquired over two or more tilt series, and reconstructs complete vector fields associated with the particle. In the present work, we consider the reconstruction of the vector potential of magnetite nanoparticles, a material of significant interest in the study of nanomagnetism. This work addresses errors, both in the recorded micrographs and those incurred during the reconstruction process, and examines the effect that these errors have on the accuracy of the reconstructed vector field. We use simulated micrographs in order to have complete control over the nature of the errors, and to be able to precisely quantify the accuracy of the reconstruction. In this thesis, we use a phase retrieval algorithm based on the transport-of-intensity equation, and reconstruct the vector potential of the simulated magnetite specimen using two tilt series and a filtered backprojection algorithm. We use three different root-mean-square error metrics to determine the accuracy of the reconstruction in terms of the total vector difference, the difference in magnitude, and the difference in direction. We then compare these results with analytical predictions. We derive expressions to predict the error in a vector field electron tomography reconstruction as functions of image noise and initial specimen orientation, and test the applicability of these expressions under a range of conditions. There is strong, quantitative agreement between our analytical and numerical results regarding the effects of image noise. Our work on orientation-dependent errors provides a semi-quantitative analysis of the total root-mean-square error as a function of magnetic moment orientation. We also present a method for reducing orientation-dependent errors by averaging reconstructions from multiple pairs of tilt series. We find that the reconstruction of the magnetic vector potential of uniformly magnetised specimens can be significantly improved by distributing the acquired images over additional tilt series. </div><br>

			<div class="abstract">Vector field electron tomography (VFET) reconstructs vector fields based on phase maps recorded from two or more orthogonal tilt series. The tomographic reconstruction of vector fields involves considerations beyond those involved in the reconstruction of scalar fields. Here we examine the effect of initial magnetization orientation on reconstruction errors. The orientation of a magnetic particle affects the contrast in the phase maps. This, in turn, affects the accuracy of the reconstructed vector fields. We derive expressions that model the dependence of reconstruction errors on initial specimen orientation when using a filtered backprojection algorithm to reconstruct a vector potential from two tilt series. We compare these analytical results with those from numerical simulations. Our results can inform experimental procedures, such as sample preparation techniques and the choice of tilt series orientations. Specimen orientation can be a significant source of error in VFET, and our results can provide the means to minimize these errors.</div><br>

			<div class="abstract">Vector-field electron tomography (VFET) reconstructs electromagnetic vector fields of magnetic nanomaterials using transmission electron microscopy. The theory behind this reconstruction process is well established, but the practical implications of experimental errors and how they affect the accuracy of the reconstructed vector fields is not well understood, hindering progress in the use of these techniques for routine magnetic characterization of nanomaterials. Here, we present an analysis of the propagation of stochastic errors through a VFET algorithm. A method for determining the contribution of image noise to errors in a reconstructed vector potential is derived. Simulations are performed to test the validity of this method when applied to shot noise, which shows good agreement with theory.</div><br>

			<div class="abstract">Vector field electron tomography (VFET) is the reconstruction of
			a vector field (the vector potential) from its projections. This re-
			quires phase contrast techniques, the acquisition of at least two
			tilt-series, and a tomographic reconstruction algorithm. In the
			present work, tomographic reconstructions were performed on
			simulated tilt series data for a transmission electron microscope.
			By varying defocus and noise level over successive simulations,
			power law relationships between optimum defocus and noise level,
			and minimum error and noise level, were found. Optimum val-
			ues for the regularisation parameter used to stabilise the phase
			retrieval algorithm were obtained. The resolution of the method
			was also investigated, with reconstruction error curves presented
			as a function of separation distance for two dipoles. This work will
			facilitate improvements in the characterisation of magnetic nano-
			materials, enabling improvements in their design.</div><br>
