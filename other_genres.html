			This section is for anything that doesn't fit into any of the other sections. It includes tracks that could fit into a specific genre if I had enough tracks of that style to give them their own section, as well as tracks that don't actually <i>have</i> a clearly defined genre.

		<span class="tooltiptext"><i>Dado</i> is a great track in my opinion. It stands out, stylistically, from a lot of my other tracks. One major difference is that the majority of it is recorded audio rather than softsynths. This includes abstract backing vocals sung by me, guitar riffs played by me, a short melodic motif I played on a tin whistle, and even a bassline sung by me. I really have no idea what genre this would best be described as&mdash;as with all of my music, it has a strong <i>trance</i> influence, but there's also <i>rock</i> and <i>psychedelic electronica</i> elements. Someone told me that they picture this playing as the characters drive off into the sunset at the end of a movie (or something to that effect), and I really like that description.</span>

		<span class="tooltiptext pos_c">I'm not a huge fan of techno, but I decided to give it a try. While I definitely managed to incorporate some quintessential techno elements into <i>Arte 7</i>, I think my propensity for Trance production comes through pretty strongly. I'm not sure how a Techno aficionado would categorise it.</span>

		<span class="tooltiptext pos_r">It's difficult to know what genre would best describe <i>Sphere of Interest</i>. It probably qualifies mostly as trance, but it also has some <i>big room</i> (or maybe some other type of electro house) elements, so some people might think it fits the "house" label better. As it's quite different to the tracks I have listed under "hard trance" and "house", I have decided to put it in "other".</span>

		<span class="tooltiptext"><i>Carbonate</i> is EDM of some sort. There's nothing particularly groundbreaking about it, so I'm sure someone more versed in Dance styles could put it in a neat little box. This track has a strong intro which builds to a climax with a highly compressed, pulsating beat.</span>

		<span class="tooltiptext pos_c"><i>Hijack</i> is one of those ones that I like a lot but feel it might not appeal to others a lot because of its lower intensity. Similar to <i>Discovery 7</i> (on the "Trance" tab), it has a somewhat 'disco-esque' beat, and the best way I could describe it is Jazz-influenced electronica. It's another one that listening to it today with fresh ears, I think it could do with more melodic variety. Given its Jazzy qualities, I think it's crying out for a solo in the middle and maybe even a crazy drum solo or something. That said, it's not a track I'm unhappy with&mdash;I just feel that I might not have exploited its full potential.</span>

		<span class="tooltiptext pos_r"><i>Oracle</i> is another one that I feel is difficult to categorise. Most of the structure of (the funky bassline and the dotted notes, for example) all point towards house, but I'm not familiar when any house sub-genre that sounds like this, and I feel that the mix as it is has zero dance/club potential, which is a pretty strong requirement of house music. It has electro elements (but is nothing like electro-house), and has an overall feel that is very 'electronic', perhaps even with some chiptune qualities. </span>
