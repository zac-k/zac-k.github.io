		<span class="tooltiptext"><i>Dado</i> is a great track in my opinion. It stands out, stylistically, from a lot of my other tracks. One major difference is that the majority of it is recorded audio rather than softsynths. This includes abstract backing vocals sung by me, guitar riffs played by me, a short melodic motif I played on a tin whistle, and even a bassline sung by me. I really have no idea what genre this would best be described as&mdash;as with all of my music, it has a strong <i>trance</i> influence, but there's also <i>rock</i> and <i>psychedelic electronica</i> elements. Someone told me that they picture this playing as the characters drive off into the sunset at the end of a movie (or something to that effect), and I really like that description.</span>

		<span class="tooltiptext pos_c">I'm not a huge fan of techno, but I decided to give it a try. While I definitely managed to incorporate some quintessential techno elements into <i>Arte 7</i>, I think my propensity for Trance production comes through pretty strongly. I'm not sure how a Techno aficionado would categorise it.</span>

		<span class="tooltiptext pos_r">It's difficult to know what genre would best describe <i>Sphere of Interest</i>. It probably qualifies mostly as trance, but it also has some <i>big room</i> (or maybe some other type of electro house) elements, so some people might think it fits the "house" label better. As it's quite different to the tracks I have listed under "hard trance" and "house", I have decided to put it in "other".</span>
