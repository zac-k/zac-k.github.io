					<i>Dado</i> is a great track in my opinion. It stands out, stylistically, from a lot of my other tracks. One major difference is that the majority of it is recorded audio rather than softsynths. This includes abstract backing vocals sung by me, guitar riffs played by me, a short melodic motif I played on a tin whistle, and even a bassline sung by me. I really have no idea what genre this would best be described as&mdash;as with all of my music, it has a strong <i>trance</i> influence, but there's also <i>rock</i> and <i>psychedelic electronica</i> elements. Someone told me that they picture this playing as the characters drive off into the sunset at the end of a movie (or something to that effect), and I really like that description.</span>

					I'm not a huge fan of techno, but I decided to give it a try. While I definitely managed to incorporate some quintessential techno elements into <i>Arte 7</i>, I think my propensity for Trance production comes through pretty strongly. I'm not sure how a Techno aficionado would categorise it.</span>

					It's difficult to know what genre would best describe <i>Sphere of Interest</i>. It probably qualifies mostly as trance, but it also has some <i>big room</i> (or maybe some other type of electro house) elements, so some people might think it fits the "house" label better. As it's quite different to the tracks I have listed under "hard trance" and "house", I have decided to put it in "other".</span>

					<i>Carbonate</i> is EDM of some sort. There's nothing particularly groundbreaking about it, so I'm sure someone more versed in Dance styles could put it in a neat little box. This track has a strong intro which builds to a climax with a highly compressed, pulsating beat.</span>

					<i>Hijack</i> is one of those ones that I like a lot but feel it might not appeal to others a lot because of its lower intensity. Similar to <i>Discovery 7</i> (on the "Trance" tab), it has a somewhat 'disco-esque' beat, and the best way I could describe it is Jazz-influenced electronica. It's another one that listening to it today with fresh ears, I think it could do with more melodic variety. Given its Jazzy qualities, I think it's crying out for a solo in the middle and maybe even a crazy drum solo or something. That said, it's not a track I'm unhappy with&mdash;I just feel that I might not have exploited its full potential.</span>

					<i>Oracle</i> is another one that I feel is difficult to categorise. Most of the structure of (the funky bassline and the dotted notes, for example) all point towards house, but I'm not familiar when any house sub-genre that sounds like this, and I feel that the mix as it is has zero dance/club potential, which is a pretty strong requirement of house music. It has electro elements (but is nothing like electro-house), and has an overall feel that is very 'electronic', perhaps even with some chiptune qualities. </span>

					<i>Afflatus</i> is one of my older tracks; it's probably close to twenty years old at this point. Although there are lots of aspects of my older work that I love, I find that the biggest shortcoming is often in development throughout the track. This isn't the case with <i>Afflatus</i>, which I find keeps me interested for the whole duration. This track has a very light 'video-gamey' sound that to this day I think is very cool. It's the sort of music I would actually have trouble producing these days because I would overthink it and use more 'clever' production techniques than are actually needed, and it would lose its charm.</span>

					This is another old track from around the same era as Afflatus. I was going for a hard trance sound, and although it sounds quite na&i;ve to my ears today, from that perspective, I still really like it for what it is. At the time, it was somewhat of a breakthrough for me regarding my production quality, and I managed to get a fairly 'big' sound, which I think is one of the tougher things to achieve when starting out. It did originally have a name, but I've long since forgotten what that is. I'm leaving it as <i>Untitled</i> for the time being, and hopefully one day I will remember its real name.</span>

					<i>Cotan</i> is a fairly relaxed track which nonetheless has some energy to it. Stylistically, it's another one I have trouble categorising. Despite have a 4/4 beat and a fairly groovy bassline, it's not a dance track.</span>

					<i>Gymnastic</i> is probably best described as tech-house, though it's less dancey than most popular examples of the style.</span>
