						  "<i>Used to Have It</i> was the first House track I produced that I was really, really happy with, and it's still probably my favourite. It's got a super chill, jazzy vibe, and a kind of 'organic' and spacious feel. There's nothing about this track that I'm unhappy with. I love the funky bassline, the synthesised saxophone sounds pretty authentic to me, and its melody has a somwhat improvisational feel, which combine to give the track a recorded instrument feeling. Female vocals are from <br><i>\"It All (This Christmas)\"</i> by Snowflake (link above). Male vocals are my own.",

						  "Alone", 
						  "alone",
						  "<i>Alone</i> is somewhat of a mix of house and vocal trance, so it was hard to know which category to put it under. However, it's very much closer in feel to my other house tracks than to my trance tracks, which are mostly anthem trance, so I've put it here. This one feels pretty polished to me, so I'm very happy with the production quality I achieved with it. I don't normally like using such long vocal samples without altering them significantly, but I wrote most of the music for this first, and when I dropped in the vocals, it just sounded so perfect that I wasn't going to alter them for the sake of it.",
